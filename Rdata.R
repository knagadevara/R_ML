## Clustring and K-Means

#Always standardize the data.

#The distance of all the points to centroid should be minimum = 'Within Sum of Squares'

#Step 1:
#  Randomly select centroid's and apply Eucledian formula to group the observations.

#Step 2:
#Update the centroid by taking the mean of all the observations in the cluster.

#Step 3:

## Time Series
## LSTM,GRV,RNN

## Arima

x = 31.5
mu = 30
s = 5
n = 100
t = ( x - mu ) / ( s / sqrt( n ) )

# Difference between Co-Variance and Co-Relation?
#Alpha is intercept.
#Beta is coeffecient, dependant on the units of the variable.

### Decision Tree
## entropy should be minimum to choose the rule.

## Machine learning we are trying to minimize a function through differentiation
## brute force method and gradient desent.In algorithms we try to optimize a function.
## Bootstrapping -> randomise minority class
## Oversampling -> repeate the minority
